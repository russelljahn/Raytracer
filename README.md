Raytracer
=========

The first raytracer I've written.



Tested On:
----------
Ubuntu
Mac OSX Mountain Lion

Prerequisites:
--------------
It uses OpenGL to draw the image to the screen, and assumes you already have any needed libraries already installed on your machine.



To Run:
-------
Navigate to the 'src' directory, and run the following commands...

make raytrace
./raytrace

To Quit:
--------
You have to manually terminate it in the terminal through CTRL+C / CMD+C.
